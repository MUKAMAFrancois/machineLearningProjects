What is Unrwa and why has Israel banned it?,Unknown,"Israel's parliament voted on Monday evening to ban the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) from operating within Israel and occupied East Jerusalem. Contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will be banned, crippling its ability to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Almost all of Gaza's population of more than two million people are dependent on aid and services from the agency. The move has faced widespread condemnation, with Unrwa warning the new law could see aid supply chains ""fall apart"" in the coming weeks. Israel has defended the move, repeating its allegation that a number of the agency's staff were involved in Hamas's 7 October attacks last year, which killed 1,200 people. However, Israel's opposition to Unrwa also goes back decades. Founded in 1949, the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or Unrwa, works in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, initially caring for the 700,000 Palestinians who were forced from or fled their homes after the creation of the state of Israel. Over the decades, Unrwa has grown to become the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza. It employs some 13,000 people there and is key to humanitarian efforts. It is funded primarily by voluntary donations by UN member states, with the UN itself providing some direct funds. It distributes aid and runs shelters and key infrastructure - such as medical facilities, teacher training centres and almost 300 primary schools. Since the war in Gaza began, the agency says it has distributed food parcels to almost 1.9 million people. It has also offered nearly six million medical consultations across the enclave over the course of the conflict. More than 200 Unrwa staff have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 2023 in the course of those duties, according to the agency. Unwra has long been criticised by Israel, with many there objecting to its very existence. The fate of refugees has been a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict, with Palestinians harbouring a dream of returning to homes in historic Palestine, parts of which are now in Israel. Israel rejects their claim and criticises the set-up of Unrwa for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations. It says this entrenches Palestinians as refugees, and encourages their hopes of a right of return. The Israeli government has also long denounced the agency's teaching and textbooks for, in its view, perpetuating anti-Israel views. In 2022, an Israeli watchdog said Unrwa educational material taught students that Israel was attempting to ""erase Palestinian identity”. The European Commission identified what it called ""anti-Semitic material"" in the schoolbooks, ""including even incitement to violence"", and the European Parliament has called repeatedly for EU funding to the Palestinian Authority to be conditional on removing such content. Unrwa has previously said reports about its educational material were ""inaccurate and misleading"" and that many of the books in question were not used in its schools. After the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, allegations that some Unrwa staff were involved further amplified calls in Israel for the agency to be banned. The military claimed that in total, more than 450 Unrwa staff were members of ""terrorist organisations"". In the wake of the allegations, some 16 Western countries temporarily suspended funding for the aid agency. The UN investigated Israel’s claim and fired nine people, but it said Israel had not provided evidence for more allegations and Unrwa denied any wider involvement with Hamas. Speaking on Monday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the allegations, writing on X that ""Unrwa workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable."" Under the new law - which was approved by 92 MPs and opposed by just 10 - contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will be banned. While most of Unrwa's projects take place in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, it relies on agreements with Israel to operate. This includes moving aid through checkpoints between Israel and Gaza. Along with the Palestinian Red Crescent, Unrwa handles almost all aid distribution in Gaza through 11 centres across the enclave. It also provides services to 19 refugee camps in the West Bank. Unrwa director William Deere told the BBC that on a practical level, the ban on interacting with Israeli officials meant it would become almost impossible for the agency's staff to operate in the country. ""We won't be able to move in Gaza without being subject to possible attack, international staff won't be able to get visas any longer,"" he said. The executive director of the UN's World Food Programme said without Unrwa's presence in Gaza, aid agencies will be unable to distribute essential food and medicine. ""They do all the work on the ground there,"" Cindy McCain told the BBC. ""We don't have the contacts. We don't have the ability to get to know the contacts, because things are so intensely difficulty there."" Prime Minister Netanyahu said on Monday that ""sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza"" despite Unrwa's ban, and that Israel would work with its international partners to ensure this. But on Monday the US state department said Israel must do ""much more"" to allow international aid to enter Gaza. The warning came two weeks after it gave Israel 30 days to boost supplies, or risk seeing some military assistance cut. Israel has not commented on the strike, which rescuers say hit a five-storey building in northern Gaza. The Lebanese health ministry said 58 were wounded in the Bekaa Valley, with rescue efforts under way. BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery from Iran to assess damage from Israeli air strikes. Israel passes two laws which Western governments fear could have devastating consequences for civilians in the Gaza Strip. Karim Khan also asks for an immediate investigation into the allegations against him. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

"Teri Garr, Young Frankenstein and Tootsie star, dies at 79",Rachel Looker,"Teri Garr, an Oscar-nominated actress best known for her work in movies including Young Frankenstein, Mr Mom and Tootsie, has died at 79, US media report. Garr died in Los Angeles on Tuesday after a 20-year battle with multiple sclerosis ""surrounded by family and friends"", her publicist Heidi Schaeffer said in a statement. She first talked publicly about the chronic autoimmune disease in 2002 to raise awareness for others living with it. The comedy actor faced other health problems and underwent an operation to repair an aneurysm in 2007, BBC's US news partner CBS reports. Garr got her start as a background dancer in Elvis Presley movies. Her mother, also a former dancer, put her in dance classes at the age of six. Her first gig was joining the road company for West Side Story in Los Angeles. She then began dancing in movies before starring in television shows like Batman and Dr. Kildare. Garr's big break came in 1974 when she played a supporting role in the thriller, The Conversation. She was then cast as Gene Wilder's lab assistant in the horror comedy Young Frankenstein where she spoke with a German accent. This was a career breakthrough for Garr. She established herself as a comedy actor and began making frequent appearances on Late Night with David Letterman. Beyond comedy, Garr also played dramatic roles in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Black Stallion. She also appeared in television shows such as Star Trek and That Girl. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Orban swipes at EU and says disputed Georgian vote was fair,Paul Kirby,"Hungary's Viktor Orban congratulated Georgia's increasingly authoritarian government in person on Tuesday, on a visit to Tbilisi three days after it won a contested election. Praising the vote as ""free and democratic"", he made no mention of the numerous allegations of vote violations. The EU made clear observers had not declared the elections to be free and fair and said the developments were ""very worrying"". Georgia's pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, has refused to recognise the result and spoken of a ""Russian special operation"" to influence the result. Orban, who had congratulated the Georgian Dream government even before the result was declared, also took a swipe at his EU partners. ""European politics has a manual. If liberals win, they say it’s democratic, but if conservatives win, there's no democracy,"" he told reporters after talks with Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. ""Here the conservatives won, so these are the disputes - you shouldn't take them too seriously."" But criticism of the conduct of the election has come from both the US and EU, which have both called for an independent investigation of violence and intimidation, as well as alleged flagrant violation of the new electronic voting process. Opposition parties and the president insist the election was ""stolen"" by a party accused of moving Georgia back into Russia's orbit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Georgians had ""a right to see that electoral irregularities are investigated swiftly, transparently and independently"". Western exit polls for opposition TV channels suggested that four opposition parties combined had won the election, before the Central Election Commission declared Georgian Dream the winner with 54% of the vote, and with it a majority in parliament. Despite criticism from EU colleagues, Viktor Orban arrived in Tbilisi on Monday night, a short distance from a large demonstration of tens of thousands of Georgians protesting against the result. Hungary holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, but the EU was at pains to point out he did not represent the 27 member states. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, who was also in Tbilisi, said it was a disgrace that the EU had not recognised the result of the Georgian vote. But he and Orban made no mention of the catalogue of violations produced by independent monitors. Georgian monitoring group ""My Vote"" has compiled an exhaustive list of the types of violations that its 1,500 observers documented on Saturday and in the run-up to the vote. My Vote said that ahead of the election, public teachers, cleaners and bus drivers were either asked to send in their IDs or had them confiscated, while families of vulnerable people were offered financial help in return for their vote. On the day of the election, My Vote says several different schemes were used: President Zourabichvili had already told the BBC that so-called carousel voting had taken place, ""when one person can vote 10, 15, 17 times with the same ID"". My Vote has called for the results from 196 polling stations to be annulled, alleging that they accounted for an extra 300,000 votes. Georgia's prime minister has denied allegations of widespread irregularities, telling the BBC the elections were generally ""in line with legal principles"". He has also denied that his government is pro-Russian and ""pro-Putinist"". Georgia's beleaguered election commission has accused its critics of a ""manipulative campaign"" of disinformation and said it would recount votes in five randomly selected polling stations in each of Georgia's 84 election districts. The commission says the US company whose system it used maintained that ""duplicating a voter on the voter list is impossible, as each voter is registered only once"". ""It is impossible to vote multiple times with a single ID, undergo double verification, or have a single voter registered across multiple precincts,"" the commission added, adding that trying to discredit the system was no more than denying reality. The Georgian president told Swiss radio that the commission was ""completely dominated by the party of power, and non-government organisations... have no influence over it"". ""This state is captured,"" said Eka Gigauri of Transparency International, which was involved in the My Vote monitoring mission. ""We know anything might happen... and we know no-one will investigate it or react."" Irakli Kobakhidze tells the BBC his ruling party won the vote by a landslide, but the president says it was a fraud. Moldovans vote narrowly to push on with EU membership and reject keeping close ties to Russia. Sunday's presidential election is seen as a vote on whether the country looks east to Russia or west to the EU. The EU chief made the comments to member states, as Italy kicks off a contested migrant processing scheme. Local authorities say the delay can be used to prepare better for the new entry and exit system. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Shawn Mendes says he's 'just figuring out' sexuality,Ana Faguy,"Singer Shawn Mendes opened up about his sexuality during a performance in Colorado on Monday, saying he's ""just figuring it out like everyone"". ""I don't really know sometimes and I know other times. It feels really scary because we live in a society that has a lot to say about that,"" he told concert-goers. According to fan footage of the concert posted on social media, Mendes made the comments before performing an unreleased song which seems to be inspired by how speculation about his sexuality made him feel. The Canadian singer has previously criticised such speculation, calling out its intrusiveness. Speaking during the performance Morrison’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Mendes said he had ""thought about this for a minute today if I was gonna say something tonight”. Cheered on by the crowd, he continued: “The truth is that I didn’t get to do a lot of 15-year-old things and discover parts of myself that you do at 15."" He continued: “There’s this thing about my sexuality, and people have been talking about it so long”, adding that it's “kind of silly, because I think sexuality is such a beautifully complex thing, and it’s so hard to just put into boxes.” “It always felt like such an intrusion on something very personal to me. Something that I was figuring out in myself, something that I had yet to discover and still have yet to discover it."" ""The real truth about my life and my sexuality is that, man, I'm just figuring it out like everyone."" He went onto speak about his unreleased song The Mountain, which includes the lyrics: ""You can say I'm too young, you can say I'm too old, you can say I like girls or boys, whatever fits your mold"". Mendes told the crowd it was important to write that new song because ""it felt like a moment where I could address it in a way that felt close to my heart"". ""And I guess I'm just speaking freely now, because I just want to be able to be closer to everyone and just kind of be in my truth,"" he added. In a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Mendes spoke about ""this massive, massive thing for the last five years about me being gay"". The next year, he told the Guardian speculation had been ""hurtful… I get mad when people assume things about me because I imagine the people who don’t have the support system I have and how that must affect them"". Mendes has had a number of chart-topping hits in the UK, US and Canada, including the single Señorita, which he released with Camilla Cabello - whom he also previously dated. Criminal charges against the 54-year-old could land him in prison - and the list of accusers is growing. 75-year-old Bruce Springsteen explains why he has no plans to stop touring. The charity had been due to close but says it can remain open for now thanks to public support. The Liverpool band is the second support act to be unveiled for the Gallagher brother's reunion tour. The hip-hop mogul is accused of sex trafficking involving drug-fuelled orgies known as ""freak-offs"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

"At least 93 killed and missing in Israeli strike on Gaza, health ministry says",Gabriela Pomeroy,"At least 93 people are dead or missing after an Israeli air strike on the town of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Rescuers said a five-storey residential building was hit, and videos on social media showed bodies covered in blankets on the floor. There has been no immediate comment on the strike from Israel's military, which began a new offensive in the area earlier this month after saying Hamas was regrouping there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been operating in northern Gaza during the past two weeks, particularly in the areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. The director of the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia, Hussam Abu Safia, told the AFP news agency that children were being treated at the hospital, which is struggling to treat patients due to a lack of staff and medicines. ""There is nothing left in the Kamal Adwan Hospital except first aid materials after the army arrested our medical team and workers,"" Abu Safia said. The IDF raided the hospital last week, saying it was being used by Hamas fighters. Israel says its operations in northern Gaza are designed to prevent Hamas from regrouping and accuses them of embedding among the civilian population, which Hamas denies. In a statement on Tuesday, it said it killed 40 “terrorists” in Jabalia, and in central Gaza it said it “eliminated many terrorists"" over the past 24 hours including some who ""attempted to plant explosives near the troops"". The northern Gaza Strip faces a deepening humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of people living in desperate conditions. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that ""the Israeli military is subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation"". He also said it was unacceptable that Palestinian armed groups were reportedly operating among civilians, including inside shelters for the displaced, and putting them in harm’s way. On Monday, Israel's parliament voted through legislation to ban the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, from operating in the country, sparking warnings the delivery of aid to Gaza could be severely impacted.. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,924 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its figures. Israel is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it hard to verify facts on the ground. Karim Khan also asks for an immediate investigation into the allegations against him. Only one doctor remains at Kamal Adwan Hospital after a days-long Israeli raid, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The BBC's Gaza correspondent is among the Palestinians who have fled their home since the war began.

"What the US election outcome means for Ukraine, Gaza and world conflict",Lyse Doucet,"When US President Joe Biden walked through Kyiv in February 2023 on a surprise visit to show solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, air sirens were wailing. “I felt something… more strongly than ever before,” he later recalled. “America is a beacon to the world.” The world now waits to see who takes charge of this self-styled beacon after Americans make their choice in next week’s presidential election. Will Kamala Harris carry on in Biden’s footsteps with her conviction that in “these unsettled times, it is clear America cannot retreat”? Or will it be Donald Trump with his hope that “Americanism, not globalism” will lead the way? We live in a world where the value of US global influence is under question. Regional powers are going their own way, autocratic regimes are making their own alliances, and the devastating wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere are raising uncomfortable questions about the value of Washington’s role. But America matters by dint of its economic and military strength, and its major role in many alliances. I turned to some informed observers for their reflections on the global consequences of this very consequential election. “I cannot sugarcoat these warnings,” says Rose Gottemoeller, Nato’s former deputy secretary general. “Donald Trump is Europe’s nightmare, with echoes of his threat to withdraw from Nato in everyone’s ears.” Washington’s defence spending amounts to two-thirds of the military budgets of Nato’s 31 other members. Beyond Nato, the US spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined, including China and Russia. Trump boasts he’s playing hardball to force other Nato countries to meet their spending targets, which is 2% of their GDP - only 23 of the member nations have hit this target in 2024. But his erratic statements still jar. If Harris wins, Ms Gottemoeller believes “Nato will no doubt be in good Washington hands.” But she has a warning there too. “She will be ready to continue working with Nato and the European Union to achieve victory in Ukraine, but she will not back off on [spending] pressure on Europe.” But Harris’s team in the White House will have to govern with the Senate or the House, which could both soon be in Republican hands, and will be less inclined to back foreign wars than their Democratic counterparts. There’s a growing sense that no matter who becomes president, pressure will mount on Kyiv to find ways out of this war as US lawmakers become increasingly reluctant to pass huge aid packages. Whatever happens, Ms Gottemoeller says, “I do not believe that Nato must fall apart.” Europe will need to “step forward to lead.” The next US president will have to work in a world confronting its greatest risk of major power confrontation since the Cold War. “The US remains the most consequential international actor in matters of peace and security”, Comfort Ero, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, tells me. She adds a caveat, “but its power to help resolve conflicts is diminished.” Wars are becoming ever harder to end. “Deadly conflict is becoming more intractable, with big-power competition accelerating and middle powers on the rise,” is how Ms Ero describes the landscape. Wars like Ukraine pull in multiple powers, and conflagrations such as Sudan pit regional players with competing interests against each other, and some more invested in war than in peace. America is losing the moral high ground, Ms Ero says. “Global actors notice that it applies one standard to Russia's actions in Ukraine, and another to Israel's in Gaza. The war in Sudan has seen terrible atrocities but gets treated as a second-tier issue.” A win by Harris, she says, “represents continuity with the current administration.” If it’s Trump, he “might give Israel an even freer hand in Gaza and elsewhere, and has intimated he could try to cut a Ukraine deal with Moscow over Kyiv’s head.” On the Middle East, the Democratic candidate has repeatedly echoed Mr Biden’s firm backing of Israel’s “right to defend itself.” But she’s also made a point of emphasising that “the killing of innocent Palestinians has to stop.” Trump has also declared it’s time to “get back to peace and stop killing people.” But he’s reportedly told the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to “do what you have to do.” The Republican contender prides himself on being a peacemaker. “I will have peace in the Middle East, and soon,” he vowed in an interview with Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya TV on Sunday night. He’s promised to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords. These bilateral agreements normalised relations between Israel and a few Arab states, but were widely seen to have sidelined the Palestinians and ultimately contributed to the current unprecedented crisis. On Ukraine, Trump never hides his admiration for strongmen like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He’s made it clear he wants to end the war in Ukraine, and with it the US’s hefty military and financial support. “I’ll get out. We gotta get out,” he insisted in a recent rally. In contrast, Harris has said: “I have been proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine. And I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war.” But Ms Ero worries that, no matter who’s elected, things could get worse in the world. “The biggest shock to the global economy for decades.” That’s the view of leading China scholar Rana Mitter regarding Trump’s proposed 60 percent tariffs on all imported Chinese goods. Imposing steep costs on China, and many other trading partners, has been one of Trump’s most persistent threats in his “America first” approach. But Trump also lauds what he sees as his own strong personal connection with President Xi Jinping. He told the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board he wouldn’t have to use military force if Beijing moved to blockade Taiwan because the Chinese leader “respects me and he knows I’m [expletive] crazy.” But both leading Republicans and Democrats are hawkish. Both see Beijing as being bent on trying to eclipse America as the most consequential power. But Mr Mitter, a British historian who holds the ST Lee Chair in US-Asia relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School, sees some differences. With Ms Harris he says, “relations would likely develop in a linear fashion from where they are now.” If Trump wins, it’s a more “fluid scenario.” For example, on Taiwan, Mr Mitter points to Trump’s ambivalence about whether he would come to the defence of an island far from America. China’s leaders believe both Harris and Trump will be tough. Mr Mitter sees it as “a small group of establishment types favour Harris as ‘better the opponent you know.’ A significant minority see Trump as a businessman whose unpredictability might just mean a grand bargain with China, however unlikely that seems.” America and... the Middle East The latest episode of the Global Story looks at what a Trump or Harris presidency could mean for violence in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding region. Listen now on BBC Sounds. If you are outside the UK, listen wherever you get your podcasts. “The US election is hugely consequential not just for its citizens but for the whole world because of the pressing imperative of the climate and nature crisis,” says Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, and former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. “Every fraction of a degree matters to avert the worst impacts of climate change and prevent a future where devastating hurricanes like Milton are the norm,” she added. But as Hurricanes Milton and Helene raged, Trump derided environmental plans and policies to confront this climate emergency as “one of the greatest scams of all time.” Many expect him to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement as he did in his first term. However, Ms Robinson believes Trump cannot stop the momentum now gathering steam. “He cannot halt the US energy transition and roll back the billions of dollars in green subsidies... nor can he stop the indefatigable non-federal climate movement.” She also urged Harris, who still hasn’t fleshed out her own stance, to step up “to show leadership, build on the momentum of recent years, and spur other major emitters to pick up the pace.” “The outcome of the US election holds immense significance, given the unparalleled influence the United States wields, not just through its military and economic might, but through its potential to lead with moral authority on the global stage,” says Martin Griffiths, a veteran conflict mediator, who, until recently, was the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. He sees greater light if Harris wins, and says that “a return to Trump’s presidency marked by isolationism and unilateralism, offers little but a deepening of global instability.” But he has criticism, too, for the Biden-Harris administration, citing its “hesitancy” over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. Aid agency bosses have repeatedly condemned Hamas’s murderous October 7th assault on Israeli civilians. But they’ve also repeatedly called on the US to do much more to end the profound suffering of civilians in Gaza as well as in Lebanon. Biden and his top officials continually called for more aid to flow into Gaza, and did make a difference at times. But critics say the aid, and the pressure, was never enough. A recent warning that some vital military assistance could be cut pushed the decision until after the US elections. The US is the single largest donor when it comes to the UN system. In 2022, it provided a record $18.1bn (£13.9bn). But in Trump’s first term, he axed funding for several UN agencies and pulled out of the World Health Organisation. Other donors scrambled to fill the gaps – which is what Trump wanted to happen. But Griffths still believes America is an indispensable power. “In a time of global conflict and uncertainty, the world longs for the US to rise to the challenge of responsible, principled leadership... We demand more. We deserve more. And we dare to hope for more.” BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

PhD student finds lost city in Mexico jungle by accident,Georgina Rannard,"A huge Maya city has been discovered centuries after it disappeared under jungle canopy in Mexico. Archaeologists found pyramids, sports fields, causeways connecting districts and amphitheatres in the southeastern state of Campeche. They uncovered the hidden complex - which they have called Valeriana - using Lidar, a type of laser survey that maps structures buried under vegetation. They believe it is second in density only to Calakmul, thought to be the largest Maya site in ancient Latin America. The team discovered three sites in total, in a survey area the size of Scotland's capital Edinburgh, “by accident” when one archaeologist browsed data on the internet. “I was on something like page 16 of Google search and found a laser survey done by a Mexican organisation for environmental monitoring,” explains Luke Auld-Thomas, a PhD student at Tulane university in the US. It was a Lidar survey, a remote sensing technique which fires thousands of laser pulses from a plane and maps objects below using the time the signal takes to return. But when Mr Auld-Thomas processed the data with methods used by archaeologists, he saw what others had missed - a huge ancient city which may have been home to 30-50,000 people at its peak from 750 to 850 AD. That is more than the number of people who live in the region today, the researchers say. Mr Auld-Thomas and his colleagues named the city Valeriana after a nearby lagoon. The find helps change an idea in Western thinking that the Tropics was where “civilisations went to die”, says Professor Marcello Canuto, a co-author in the research. Instead, this part of the world was home to rich and complex cultures, he explains. We can’t be sure what led to the demise and eventual abandonment of the city, but the archaeologists say climate change was a major factor. Valeriana has the “hallmarks of a capital city” and was second only in density of buildings to the spectacular Calakmul site, around 100km away (62 miles). It is “hidden in plain sight”, the archaeologists say, as it is just 15 minutes hike from a major road near Xpujil where mostly Maya people now live. There are no known pictures of the lost city because “no-one has ever been there”, the researchers say, although local people may have suspected there were ruins under the mounds of earth. The city, which was about 16.6 sq km, had two major centres with large buildings around 2km (1.2 miles) apart, linked by dense houses and causeways. It has two plazas with temple pyramids, where Maya people would have worshipped, hidden treasures like jade masks and buried their dead. It also had a court where people would have played an ancient ball game. There was also evidence of a reservoir, indicating that people used the landscape to support a large population. In total, Mr Auld-Thomas and Prof Canuto surveyed three different sites in the jungle. They found 6,764 buildings of various sizes. Professor Elizabeth Graham from University College London, who was not involved in the research, says it supports claims that Maya lived in complex cities or towns, not in isolated villages. ""The point is that the landscape is definitely settled - that is, settled in the past - and not, as it appears to the naked eye, uninhabited or ‘wild’,"" she says. The research suggests that when Maya civilisations collapsed from 800AD onwards, it was partly because they were so densely populated and could not survive climate problems. ""It's suggesting that the landscape was just completely full of people at the onset of drought conditions and it didn't have a lot of flexibility left. And so maybe the entire system basically unravelled as people moved farther away,"" says Mr Auld-Thomas. Warfare and the conquest of the region by Spanish invaders in the 16th century also contributed to eradication of Maya city states. Lidar technology has revolutionised how archaeologists survey areas covered in vegetation, like the Tropics, opening up a world of lost civilisations, explains Prof Canuto. In the early years of his career, surveys were done by foot and hand, using simple instruments to check the ground inch by inch. But in the decade since Lidar was used in the Mesoamerican region, he says it’s mapped around 10 times the area that archaeologists managed in about a century of work. Mr Auld-Thomas says his work suggests there are many sites out there that archaeologists have no idea about. In fact so many sites have been found that researchers cannot hope to excavate them all. ""I've got to go to Valeriana at some point. It's so close to the road, how could you not? But I can't say we will do a project there,"" says Mr Auld-Thomas. ""One of the downsides of discovering lots of new Maya cities in the era of Lidar is that there are more of them than we can ever hope to study,"" he adds. The research is published in the academic journal Antiquity.

"Teri Garr, Young Frankenstein and Tootsie star, dies at 79",Rachel Looker,"Teri Garr, an Oscar-nominated actress best known for her work in movies including Young Frankenstein, Mr Mom and Tootsie, has died at 79, US media report. Garr died in Los Angeles on Tuesday after a 20-year battle with multiple sclerosis ""surrounded by family and friends"", her publicist Heidi Schaeffer said in a statement. She first talked publicly about the chronic autoimmune disease in 2002 to raise awareness for others living with it. The comedy actor faced other health problems and underwent an operation to repair an aneurysm in 2007, BBC's US news partner CBS reports. Garr got her start as a background dancer in Elvis Presley movies. Her mother, also a former dancer, put her in dance classes at the age of six. Her first gig was joining the road company for West Side Story in Los Angeles. She then began dancing in movies before starring in television shows like Batman and Dr. Kildare. Garr's big break came in 1974 when she played a supporting role in the thriller, The Conversation. She was then cast as Gene Wilder's lab assistant in the horror comedy Young Frankenstein where she spoke with a German accent. This was a career breakthrough for Garr. She established herself as a comedy actor and began making frequent appearances on Late Night with David Letterman. Beyond comedy, Garr also played dramatic roles in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Black Stallion. She also appeared in television shows such as Star Trek and That Girl. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Former Trump aide Steve Bannon released from jail,Ana Faguy,"Former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon has been released from prison after spending four months behind bars. Bannon, 70, was released from a Danbury, Connecticut, correctional facility on Tuesday, Benjamin O'Cone, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman, told the BBC. Bannon, a conservative podcast host who was key to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022 for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena related to a January 6 Capitol riot investigation. “The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me,” Bannon said on his podcast following his release. “I am more energised and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life.” Bannon is expected to hold a news conference in New York City later Tuesday. Before he was sent to jail, he promised to continue to help Trump and his campaign from behind bars. ""I've served my country now for the last 10 or so years focusing on this,"" he told the BBC before going to prison, referring to politics and Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. ""If I have to do it in a prison, I do it in a prison - it makes no difference at all."" Bannon has remained loyal to Trump and hostile towards Democratic figures, despite a falling out between the two during Trump's presidency. ""I’m a political prisoner of Nancy Pelosi, I’m a political prisoner of Merrick Garland; I’m a political prisoner of Joe Biden and the corrupt Biden establishment,"" he said before going to jail. The Trump loyalist claimed on his podcast in May that Democrats were ""going to do everything to steal this election"". He has repeatedly falsely claimed that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Bannon is still facing other legal troubles - having been indicted on charges of money laundering, fraud and conspiracy in a separate New York state case in 2022. He has been accused of cheating donors to a fundraiser that promised to build a portion of a wall on the US-Mexico border. Bannon has pled not guilty to the charges. The Oscar-nominated actress died of multiple sclerosis after battling the autoimmune disease for more than 20 years. The rap mogul faces criminal charges and lawsuits from a number of alleged victims.

Jeff Bezos defends Washington Post's end to election endorsements,Ana Faguy,"Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has defended his newspaper's decision to stop making presidential endorsements, saying the move could help improve credibility. Mr Bezos, who is also the Amazon founder, argued in an article on the Post's website on Monday that presidential endorsements created the ""perception of bias"" and did not ""tip the scales"" of an election. The comments follow public scrutiny, as well as the newspaper's reported loss of thousands of subscribers and the resignation of some editorial staff members. The decision to stop endorsing a presidential candidate - which was announced just days before the election - broke with a custom the Post had generally followed for decades. ""No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, 'I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement'. None,"" Mr Bezos wrote in his defence of the move. ""What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one."" The paper has endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s, though when it announced the move, CEO William Lewis described the decision as a return ""to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates"". The Washington Post Guild's leadership - which represents workers at the paper - said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the decision. ""We are already seeing cancellations from once-loyal readers,"" the Guild said in its statement. ""This decision undercuts the work of our of members at a time when we should be building our readers' trust, not losing it."" The paper has lost as many as 200,000 digital subscribers, and several editorial staff including board members have stepped down, according to a report by NPR. The Post itself declined to comment, and Mr Bezos has not addressed the report. In its own news article on the decision, The Washington Post reported - citing two sources briefed on the sequence of events who were not authorised to speak publicly - that editorial staffers had planned to endorse Vice-President Kamala Harris, but the article was never published. Mr Bezos denied the timing of the decision was a ""intentional strategy"" and chalked it up to ""inadequate planning"". ""I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it,"" Mr Bezos wrote. But he said the paper would need to ""exercise new muscles"" to stay competitive and current. The Washington Post owner also denied the decision was a ""quid pro quo of any kind"" with Harris or her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump. In addition to The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and USA Today have also announced they will not endorse a presidential candidate this time.

Mount Fuji remains snowless for longer than ever before,Megan Fisher,"Mount Fuji is still without snow, making it the latest time in the year the mountain has remained bare since records began 130 years ago. The peaks of Japan's highest mountain typically get a sprinkling of snow by early October, but unusually warm weather has meant no snowfall has been reported so far this year. In 2023 snow was first seen on the summit on 5 October, according to AFP news agency. Japan had its joint hottest summer on record this year with temperatures between June and August being 1.76C (3.1F) higher than an average. In September, temperatures continued to be warmer than expected as the sub-tropical jet stream's more northerly position allowed a warmer southerly flow of air over Japan. A jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air that travels around the planet. It occurs when warmer air from the south meets cooler air from the north. Nearly 1,500 areas had what Japan's Meteorological Society classed as ""extremely hot"" days - when temperatures reach or exceed 35C (95F) last month. The temperature has to be around freezing for rain to turn into snow. October has seen the heat ease slightly, but it has still been a warmer than average month. However, approaching November without snowfall marks the longest wait in the year for a snowcap on the summit since data was first collected in 1894. The previous record of 26 October has been seen twice before in 1955 and 2016, Yutaka Katsuta, a forecaster at Kofu Local Meteorological Office told AFP. While a single event cannot automatically be attributed to climate change, the observed lack of snowfall on Mount Fuji is consistent with what climate experts predict in a warming world. Mount Fuji, south-west of Tokyo, is Japan's highest mountain at 3,776m (12,460 ft). The volcano, which last erupted just over 300 years ago, is visible from the Japanese capital on a clear day. It is featured prominently in historic Japanese artwork, including wood blocks prints. Last year, more than 220,000 people made the ascent to the peak between July and September.

Nigerian MP apologises after viral taxi slapping video,Lucy Fleming,"Nigerian MP Alex Ikwechegh has apologised after a video went viral of him slapping and verbally abusing a taxi driver who had come to deliver food to his house. “I sincerely apologise for my words and actions during this incident… As a public servant, I understand the weight of my role and how my words can impact others,” said the politician who was questioned by police over the incident on Sunday evening. Bolt driver Stephen Abuwatseya accepted a job to deliver some snails to Ikwechegh’s home in the capital, Abuja, and began recording their conversation after an argument started over payment. The lawmaker had accused the driver of disrespecting him and went on to slap him in the clip. What appeared to have angered the 44-year-old politician from Abia state in south-eastern Nigeria was the driver’s request that he come outside to collect the delivery. “So, you think I will give you my money with the way you have spoken to me?” he asked in the video recording. Mr Abuwatseya responded: “I did a job for you, and you have to pay me, sir.” The MP then phoned the snail seller to complain about the driver’s behaviour: “How can this stupid idiot come to my house and tell me that I’m supposed to come and meet him in his car and pick up snail that I’m buying from you? “Can you imagine this rat? I can make this man to disappear in the whole of Nigeria and nothing would happen.” He then turned back to the driver and continued the argument, asking if he knew who he was, repeatedly saying: “How dare you?” He continued: “I will beat you up. I will show you that I’m a big brother to you. I will slap the hell out of you, lie you down, and lock you in my generator house. How dare you?” When Mr Abuwatseya later made it clear he was recording, the MP challenged him to call the police chief. The recording stopped when it appears the MP grabbed at the phone. In a later clip the driver is seen bare-chested and alleges the politician tore his shirt off and had slapped him three times in total. In a statement on Monday, the police said they were investigating the matter and urged people to refrain from using the inspector general of police’s name “to intimidate others”. In his statement, released on Tuesday, Ikwechegh extended his “heartfelt apologies” to the police chief “ recognising the unintended disparagement my remarks may have caused to his person, his office, and the entire institution”. He also apologised to the House of Representatives, which, according to local media, has since referred the matter to its ethics committee. “This incident has been a humbling reminder of the necessity for restraint and self-control, especially in challenging circumstances,” the legislator said. “I am committed to using this experience as an opportunity for growth, both as a citizen and as a more empathetic representative of the people.” Ikwechegh said he and Mr Abuwatseya had “explored alternative dispute resolution methods” to sort out the issue and had reached a “respectful resolution”.

"Hotel collapse in Argentina kills one, say reports",Alex Boyd,"One person is reportedly dead and a number of others believed trapped in debris after a hotel collapsed in Argentina. The 10-storey Dubrovnik hotel, in the coastal city of Villa Gesell, collapsed early on Tuesday, said Reuters news agency, quoting the local municipality. Up to 15 people are believed to have been inside the hotel, which had recently been undergoing renovation. Rescue teams are working at the scene attempting to free those thought to be trapped. Local media report that a man in his 80s died as a result of the incident and one woman has so far been rescued. Local authorities said building work at the hotel had been halted in August on the orders of the municipality, because the renovations were being carried out without the proper permits. However, neighbours told journalists that work on the building had been continuing in defiance of the suspension order. Argentina's national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, posted on X that two specialised teams had been sent to the scene, which is in Buenos Aires province. She said that structural engineers, rescue specialists and a dog team trained in collapsed buildings were attending, as well as personnel equipped with specialist machinery and resources to help the rescue effort. The province's own security minister, Javier Alonso, told local radio that four bricklayers working on the site had escaped the collapse and had been detained by police. Alonso added that neighbours told him that repairs might have been taking place in the hotel's basement and that the building then collapsed on itself. Photographs from the scene show widespread damage to surrounding buildings from fallen debris. Villa Gesell is a popular coastal destination with a number of hotels, resorts and beaches. The Dubrovnik is located next to other hotels in Avenue 1 and is about five minutes' walk from the seafront. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

'Unrwa means everything to us': Gazans fear aid collapse,Yolande Knell,"People in war-torn Gaza are already struggling with a deep humanitarian crisis - but now they fear it will get much more difficult because of Israel’s ban on the biggest UN agency which operates there. “Unrwa means everything to us: it is our life, our food, our drink and our medical care. When it closes, there will be no flour. If my son gets sick, where will I go?” asks Yasmine el-Ashry in Khan Younis. “Banning Unrwa is another war for the Palestinian people,” said registered refugee Saeed Awida. “They want to exterminate the Palestinian people and not provide us with humanitarian services.” Despite international opposition, in Israel’s parliament there was wide support for the new legislation, which will prevent Israeli officials being in contact with Unrwa - the UN's relief and works agency for Palestinian refugees in the Near East. The agency is accused of being complicit with Hamas. ""A terrorist organisation has completely taken over it,” claims Sharren Haskel from the opposition National Unity Party - a co-sponsor of the bill. ""If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organisation from terrorism, from Hamas activists, then we have to take measures to make sure they cannot harm our people ever again."" Unrwa insists on its own neutrality. It says that if the new Israeli laws against it are implemented as planned in three-months’ time, the effect will be profound, particularly in the occupied Palestinian territories. “It would essentially make it impossible for us to operate in Gaza,” Sam Rose, Unrwa’s Gaza deputy director, has said. “We wouldn’t be able to bring in supplies, because that has to take place in co-ordination with Israeli officials. It wouldn’t further be able for us to manage our movements safely in and out of Gaza around checkpoints, but just in and around conflict zones.” He points out that the protected status of Unrwa schools, clinics and other buildings where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have been sheltering would effectively be lost. Israeli media suggest that there were warnings from diplomats and the security establishment about the consequences of taking action against Unrwa. Israel stands accused of being in breach of the UN charter and its obligations under international humanitarian law. However, ultimately domestic politics outweighed these considerations Unrwa was set up in 1949 by the UN General Assembly in the wake of the first Arab-Israeli war which followed the creation of the state of Israel. It helped some 700,000 Palestinians who had fled or been forced from their homes. Seven decades on, with the descendants of those original refugees registered, the number of Palestinians supported by Unrwa has grown to six million across Gaza, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. It helps them with aid, assistance, education and health services. The agency has long been a lightning rod for Israeli criticism, for example with allegations that the textbooks used in its schools promote hatred of Israel. However, this has grown dramatically since Hamas’s 7 October attack last year. Last week, Unrwa confirmed that a Hamas commander killed in an Israeli strike had been an employee since 2022. He was apparently filmed leading the killing and kidnapping of Israelis from a bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im. The UN launched an investigation after Israel charged that 12 Unrwa staff took part in the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel; seven more cases later came to light. In August, Unrwa said that nine staff members out of the thousands it employs in Gaza may have been involved in the attacks and had been fired. “We have taken immediate and strong and direct action against any allegations that we have received,” maintains Sam Rose. Israel has long complained that the existence of Unrwa perpetuates the problem of Palestinian refugees – a core issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. UN officials counter that this can only be solved as part of a negotiated political settlement. But in Gaza, where most of the 2.3 million population are registered refugees, the new actions against Unrwa are also seen as a troubling attack on their status. “I am telling you that the word “refugee” will disappear. They do not want the word refugee. Israel is looking for this,” Mohammed Salman from Deir al-Balah told the BBC. Rescuers say the strike hit a five-storey building in northern Gaza - Israel says it is looking into it. Israel passes two laws which Western governments fear could have devastating consequences for civilians in the Gaza Strip. Karim Khan also asks for an immediate investigation into the allegations against him. Only one doctor remains at Kamal Adwan Hospital after a days-long Israeli raid, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

Lebanon says 60 killed in Israel strikes on eastern valley,George Wright,"At least 60 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, the Lebanese health ministry said. Two children were among those killed in strikes which targeted 16 areas in the Baalbek region, officials said. The ministry said 58 people were wounded, adding rescue efforts were still under way in the valley, which is a Hezbollah stronghold. The Israeli military has not yet commented. Israel has carried out thousands of air strikes across Lebanon over the past five weeks, targeting what it says are Hezbollah's operatives, infrastructure and weapons. Governor Bachie Khodr called the attacks the ""most violent"" in the area since Israel escalated the conflict against Hezbollah last month. Unverified video posted on social media showed damage to buildings and forests ablaze, as rescuers searched for the injured. In the town of Boudai, videos on social media appeared to show residents pleading for heavy equipment to be sent to help rescue people believed to be trapped. The regional head of Baalbek's Civil Defence crews told the BBC that the air strikes were like a ""ring of fire"". 'It was a very violent night,"" Bilal Raad said. ""It was like a ring of fire has suddenly surrounded the area."" He added the attacks had targeted ""residential quarters where civilians live or near them"", and said a lack of equipment had hampered search and rescue efforts. The town of Al-Allaq was hardest hit with 16 people killed, all from the same family, he said. Baalbek is home to the ancient Roman ruins of Heliopolis - a UNESCO World Heritage site - where, in Roman times, thousands of pilgrims went to worship three deities. A UNESCO spokesperson said that analysis of satellite images had not revealed any damage within the perimeter of the inscribed site of Baalbek. They added they were ""closely following the impact of the ongoing crisis in Lebanon on the cultural heritage sites"". Earlier on Monday, Israeli air strikes on the coastal city of Tyre left seven dead and 17 injured, Lebanon's health ministry said. Israel issued a warning for people to leave the centre of the city. Hezbollah said it clashed with Israeli troops near Lebanon's southern border on Monday and fired rockets at a naval base inside Israel near Haifa. Cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah broke out after the armed Lebanese group started firing rockets in and around northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. The Lebanese health ministry says more than 2,700 people have been killed and more than 12,400 wounded in Lebanon since then. Israel invaded southern Lebanon in a dramatic escalation on 30 September to destroy, it said, Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”. Lebanon's government says up to 1.3 million people have been internally displaced as a result of the conflict. The series of air strikes are reported to have hit missile sites and air defence systems. Two-year-old Ivana's family were about to flee their home in southern Lebanon when the strike hit. Israel is accused of targeting a compound housing journalists in southern Lebanon. Fouad Hassan, who lost family in the attack on south Beirut’s Jnah neighbourhood, describes how buildings were brought down on residents with no warning. Israel damaged more buildings in two weeks than in a year of fighting with Hezbollah, data shows. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Hezbollah announces Naim Qassem as new leader,Jacqueline Howard,"Hezbollah has announced the group’s deputy secretary general will become its new head. Naim Qassem replaces long-term leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut last month. He is one of the few senior Hezbollah leaders who remains alive, after Israel killed most of the group’s leadership in a series of attacks.

For more than 30 years, Naim Qassem was Hezbollah’s deputy secretary general and one of the group's most recognised faces. Hezbollah said he was elected by the Shura Council, in accordance with the group’s rules. His whereabouts are unclear, however some reports suggest he has fled to Iran, which is Hezbollah’s main supporter. He was born in Beirut in 1953 to a family from Lebanon's south. Qassem was one of Hezbollah's founding members and since Nasrallah's death in an Israeli air strike he has made three televised addresses. In one speech, he said a ceasefire was the only way Israel could guarantee the return of its residents to the north. Announcing Qassem's promotion, Hezbollah released a statement describing him as ""bearing the blessed banner in this march"". The statement also honoured the late Nasrallah and others killed in the conflict. The new Hezbollah leadership was expected to be passed to cleric Hashem Safieddine, but on 22 October it was revealed that he had been killed in an Israeli air strike nearly three weeks prior. Reacting to Qassem's appointment on social media, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant described it as a ""temporary appointment"" and ""not for long"". Israel has carried out air strikes across Lebanon in recent weeks, targeting what it says are Hezbollah's operatives, infrastructure and weapons. On Monday night, the Israeli military carried out air strikes in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 60 people were killed and more than 50 wounded. The Israeli military has yet to comment on the attack. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. Over the past year, more than 2,700 people have been killed and nearly 12,500 injured in Lebanon, according to the country's health ministry. Hezbollah has attacked Israel with thousands of rockets and drones over the same period, and at least 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. The Lebanese health ministry said 58 were wounded in the Bekaa Valley, with rescue efforts under way. BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery from Iran to assess damage from Israeli air strikes. Only one doctor remains at Kamal Adwan Hospital after a days-long Israeli raid, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The series of air strikes are reported to have hit missile sites and air defence systems. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refrained from pledging immediate retaliation while President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tehran did not seek war. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

What satellite images reveal about Israel's strikes on Iran,Benedict Garman & Shayan Sardarizadeh,"Satellite images analysed by BBC Verify show damage to a number of military sites in Iran from Israeli air strikes on Saturday. They include sites experts say were used for missile production and air defence, including one previously linked to Iran’s nuclear programme. Satellite imagery following the Israeli strikes shows damage to buildings at what experts say is a major weapons development and production facility at Parchin, about 30km (18.5 miles) east of Tehran. The site has been linked to rocket production according to experts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Comparing high-resolution satellite imagery taken on 9 September with an image captured on 27 October, it appears that at least four structures have been significantly damaged. One of these structures, known as Taleghan 2, has been previously linked to Iran’s nuclear programme by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) In 2016 the IAEA found evidence of uranium particles at the site, raising questions about banned nuclear activity there. Another site apparently targeted in the Israeli air strikes is at Khojir, about 20km north-west of Parchin. Fabian Hinz of the ISS says “Khojir is known as the area with the highest concentration of ballistic missile-related infrastructure within Iran.” It was the site of a mysterious large explosion in 2020. Satellite photos show at least two buildings in the complex appear to have been severely damaged. Analysts from Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, concluded that damage to Iranian facilities believed to be linked to rocket fuel production at both Parchin and Khojir will ultimately undermine Iran’s ability to “fire another salvo of the scale necessary to breach Israeli air defences”. A military site at Shahroud, about 350km to the east of Tehran, has also sustained damage, according to satellite imagery taken after the Israeli strikes. Located in the northern province of Semnan, this area is significant because it’s been involved in the production of long-range missile components, according to Fabian Hinz of the IISS. Nearby is the Shahroud Space Centre, controlled by the Revolutionary Guards Corps, from which Iran launched a military satellite into space in 2020. Israel has claimed that it successfully targeted Iran’s aerial defence systems at number of locations but it’s difficult to confirm this with the satellite imagery available. We have obtained satellite imagery which appears to show damage to a site described by experts as a radar installation. It's located on Shah Nakhjir mountain close to the western city of Ilam, and Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at Janes, a defence intelligence company, says this may have been a newly updated radar defence system. The site itself was established decades ago, but satellite pictures analysed by open source experts show it has undergone major renovation in recent years. We've also identified what appears to be damage to a storage unit at the Abadan Oil Refinery based in the south-western province of Khuzestan. However, we don’t know what caused it and there is likely to be damage in some areas across Iran caused by debris or misfiring defence systems. The New York Times cited Israeli officials as saying that the Abadan oil refinery was one of the sites targeted in its air strikes on Saturday morning. Iranian authorities confirmed on Saturday that Khuzestan province had been targeted by Israel. Abadan oil refinery is the country’s largest, capable of producing 500,000 barrels a day, according to its chief executive. Satellite imagery isn't always conclusive in identifying damaged structures. For example, a photograph we have verified showing smoke rising near Hazrat Amir Brigade Air Defence base suggested it had been successfully targeted. But satellite imagery of the area captured on Sunday has too many shadows to confirm any damage to the site. Iran launched a missile attack on Israel at the start of October for the second time this year, after firing 300 missiles and drones in April.

Iran leader says Israeli attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed',Ido Vock,"Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has given a measured response to Israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be ""exaggerated or downplayed"" while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation. President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would ""give an appropriate response"" to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that Tehran did not seek war. Israel said it targeted military sites in several regions of Iran on Saturday in retaliation for Iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had crippled Iranian air defence and missile production systems. He said the strikes had ""severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles"". ""The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals,"" Netanyahu said at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 October attacks by Hamas. ""This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him."" Official Iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems. In his first public comments since the attack, Khamenei said: ""It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country."" He adopted a much more measured tone compared to previous fiery and menacing language. In the past, he has threatened to “flatten Haifa and Tel Aviv” if Israel attacked Iran, or to “hit Israel 10 times if they strike once”. It is uncharacteristic for Khamenei to delegate responsibility to “authorities”, as the commander-in-chief. He has consistently influenced major political decisions in the past 35 years as the supreme leader, undermining the role of the president. This could be an attempt to avoid appearing weak for not responding decisively or to deflect blame if a retaliation were to backfire. President Pezeshkian largely echoed Khamenei's language, telling a cabinet meeting: ""We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country."" The Israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. The US had publicly pressured Netanyahu's government not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by Israel. The Iranian foreign minister said on Sunday that Iran had ""received indications"" about an impending attack hours before it took place. ""We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night,"" Abbas Araghchi told reporters, without going into more detail. Western countries have urged Iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both Middle Eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war. Iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the ""limited"" damage as a victory, a choice analysts said was intended to reassure Iranians. Fighting continued between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the town of Sidon in southern Lebanon killed at least eight people, according to local authorities. Late on Sunday Lebanon said at least 21 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on the south of the country. In Gaza, nine people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the al-Shati refugee camp, Palestinians officials said. Palestinian media and the Reuters news agency said three of the dead were Palestinian journalists, citing government officials. And in Israel, a man was killed and at least 30 injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv, in what authorities said was a suspected terror attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, which would involve an exchange of four Israeli hostages for some Palestinian prisoners. He said that within 10 days of implementing such a temporary ceasefire, talks should resume with the aim of reaching a more permanent one. But speaking to the BBC's Arabic Service, a senior Hamas official said its conditions for a ceasefire - rejected by Israel for months - have not changed. Sami Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian militant group continued to demand a complete ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a serious prisoner swap deal. ""Any agreement that does not guarantee these conditions holds no value,"" he added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,924 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Puerto Ricans in must-win Pennsylvania say Trump rally joke won’t be forgotten,Bernd Debusmann Jr,"In the North Philadelphia neighbourhood of Fairhill, signs of Puerto Rico are never far off. The US island territory's red, white and blue flag adorns homes and businesses, and the sounds of salsa and reggaetón boom from passing cars and restaurants selling fried plantains and spit-roasted pork. The area is the beating heart of Philadelphia's more than 90,000-strong Puerto Rican population and forms a key part of Pennsylvania's Latino community, which both the Democrats and Republicans have sought to woo ahead of the 5 November election. But on Monday morning, many locals were left seething at a joke made at Donald Trump's rally the night before in New York, in which comic Tony Hinchcliffe described Puerto Rico as an ""island of garbage"". The joke, some said, could come back to haunt the Republicans in a key swing state that Democrats won by a narrow margin of 1.17% - about 82,000 votes - in 2020. ""The campaign just hurt itself, so much. It's crazy to me,"" said Ivonne Torres Miranda, a local resident who said she remains disillusioned by both candidates - Republican Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris - with just eight days to go in the campaign. ""Even if he [Mr Hinchcliffe ] was joking - you don't joke like that. ""We're Puerto Ricans. We have dignity, and we have pride,"" she told the BBC, speaking in rapid-fire Spanish with a strong Puerto Rican accent. ""You've got to think before saying things."" In the aftermath, the Trump campaign was quick to distance itself from Mr Hinchcliffe's joke, with a spokesman saying the remark ""does not reflect the views"" of Trump or his campaign. The Harris campaign pounced on the joke, with the vice-president pointing to the comment as a sign that Trump is ""fanning the fuel of trying to divide"" Americans. Her views were echoed by Puerto Rican celebrities Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, who both endorsed Harris on Sunday. A campaign official told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the controversy was a political gift to the Democrats. Some Puerto Rican residents agree with that assessment. ""[The joke] just put it in the bag for us. He literally just gave us the win,"" said Jessie Ramos, a Harris supporter. ""He has no idea how hard the Latino community is going to come out and support Kamala Harris."" Residents of Puerto Rico - a US island territory in the Caribbean - are unable to vote in presidential elections, but the large diaspora in the US can. Across Pennsylvania, about 600,000 eligible voters are Latino. More than 470,000 of them are Puerto Ricans - one of the largest concentrations in the country and a potential deciding factor in a state where polls show Harris and Trump in an extremely tight race. North Philadelphia in particular has been a target for Harris, who on Sunday made a campaign stop at Freddy & Tony's, a Puerto Rican restaurant and community hub in Fairhill. The same day, Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico, promising economic development and improved disaster relief and accusing Trump of having ""abandoned and insulted"" the island during Hurricane Maria in 2017. Whether or not this will sway Puerto Rican voters remains to be seen. Freddy & Tony's owner, Dalma Santiago, told the BBC that she is not sure whether the joke will make a difference but that she believed that it was heard ""loud and clear"" in Fairhill and other Puerto Rican communities. ""Everybody has their own opinion,"" she told the BBC. ""But nobody will be forgetting that one."" Similarly, Moses Santana, a 13-year US Army veteran who works at a harm reduction facility in Fairhill, said he is unsure of the joke's impact. In an interview with the BBC on a Fairhill street corner, Mr Santana said the area is traditionally weary of politicians of all kinds, with many believing that both parties have failed to address socio-economic issues, crime and drug abuse there. ""Folks around here tend not to get what they ask for,"" he added. ""Even when they vote."" On Tuesday, Trump will campaign in Allentown, a town of about 125,000 in central Pennsylvania where about 33,000 people identify as Puerto Rican. But even among Trump supporters in Pennsylvania's wider Latino community, the joke was poorly received. That included Republican voter Jessenia Anderson, a Puerto Rican resident from the town of Johnstown about 240 miles (386 km) west of Philadelphia. Ms Anderson, a military veteran who was born in New York's heavily Puerto Rican Lower East Side, is a frequent attendee of Trump rallies in Pennsylvania. She described the joke as ""deeply offensive"" and said the routine felt ""wildly out of place"" - and implored her fellow Republicans to engage in ""thoughtful and respectful conversations"". But Ms Anderson has no plan to switch her vote. ""My belief in the party's potential to make a positive impact remains strong,"" she said. ""I hope they will approach Latino voters with the respect they deserve.""
